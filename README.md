Skripts to tinker with my music collection

Here I want to rewrite or refactor my already existing code fragments into reusable code. Goal is to build a software base to use for often dreamed future projects around my music collection.

I'm using Python, thinking about more docker and maybe kubernetes (if I see any useful reason for it besides playing with it!), AI in limited directions (I will not let AI "music in the style of x with y as a singer and sounding like z in the 70s on his best album")

Purely hobby at this point. But I want to finally get better in things I started long ago, instead of starting something new.
